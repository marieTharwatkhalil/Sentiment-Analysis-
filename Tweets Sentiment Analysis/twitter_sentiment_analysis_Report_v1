Twitter sentiment analysis

Problem Description: 
an application is required to search and apply sentiment analysis on tweets.
then applying a classifier as an example: Naive Bayes.
finally visualizing the result

Solution Description: 
-asking the users to enter the word they want the application to search for
-specifying the number of tweets to search for   
-searching for a specific term(word) using twitter API.
-retrieving a specific number of tweets.
-finding the polarity(classifying and counting the retrieved tweets into three categories Positive, Negative, or Neutral).
-analyzing the sentiment of all tweets.
-Visualizing the results using a Pie Chart

known Bugs:
-the application is not able to find all search terms
-when it can not find the given word, it causes an error in the graph(last cell) 

Note:
I solved some errors using try, except 
I`m working on the project to solve all bugs and errors and to apply Naive Bayes Classifier...
